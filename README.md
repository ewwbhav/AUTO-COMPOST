#SSIP AutoCompost: Smart AI-Powered Composting Bin ♻️🤖**Current Status:** TRL 3 (Proof of Concept) - Electronics & Algorithms Validated.

📖 Project OverviewThe **SSIP AutoCompost** is a smart, automated solution for organic waste management. It automates the composting process using a microcontroller-driven system with motorized mixing and environmental monitoring. The system uses **TinyML (Machine Learning on the Edge)** to intelligently classify compost health and automate maintenance (aeration/cooling) with minimal human intervention.

###Key Features* **Automated Operation:** Manages organic waste decomposition with minimal user effort.
* **Smart Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of Compost Temperature, Soil Moisture, Ambient Humidity, and Air Quality (Gas/Odors).
* **Dual-Mode Firmware:** Features a data-collection mode for training and an AI-inference mode for autonomous decision-making.
* **Mechanical Control:** High-torque DC gear motor (via BTS7960) for mixing and high-speed fan for aeration.
* **Energy Efficient:** Designed for low-power operation with support for battery/solar power.

##🚀 Development Process (How It Works)This project follows a "Data-First" Machine Learning workflow. The firmware is split into two stages to enable the system to learn from its specific environment.

###Phase 1: Data Collection & "Standard" Logic**Firmware:** `src/firmware_v1_data_collection.cpp`

* **Goal:** To gather training data while maintaining basic compost health.
* **Logic:** Uses hard-coded thresholds (e.g., `If Temp > 60°C THEN Fan ON`) and timers (Mix every 12 hours).
* **Output:** The system logs sensor readings to the Serial Monitor in CSV format:
`AmbientTemp, Humidity, SoilMoisture, CompostTemp, GasPPM`
* **Action:** We run this phase for 1-2 weeks to capture the behavior of the compost bin in different states (Healthy, Dry, Toxic).

###Phase 2: AI Model Training* **Goal:** To teach the ESP32 to recognize compost states.
* **Workflow:**
1. Export CSV data from Phase 1.
2. Label the data manually (0=Healthy, 1=Dry, 2=Toxic).
3. Train a Neural Network using **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** or **Edge Impulse**.
4. Generate a C++ library file (`model_data.h`) containing the trained model weights.



###Phase 3: Sophisticated AI Control**Firmware:** `src/firmware_v2_ai_inference.cpp`

* **Goal:** Autonomous, intelligent control.
* **Logic:** The system feeds live sensor data into the TFLite model. The AI outputs a probability for the current state.
* *Example:* "I am 90% sure the pile is becoming Toxic." -> **Action:** Pre-emptive aeration (Fan ON) before the smell becomes noticeable.


* **Advantage:** Detects complex conditions (e.g., "High Moisture + High Temp + Rising Gas") that simple `IF/ELSE` statements might miss.

##⚠️ Setup & Calibration Notes1. **MQ-135 Burn-in:** The gas sensor requires 24-48 hours of pre-heating to give stable readings.
2. **Moisture Calibration:**
* `Dry Value` (Air): ~3200 (Raw ADC)
* `Wet Value` (Water): ~1400 (Raw ADC)
* *Update these in `firmware_v1` before uploading.*


3. **Voltage Safety:** Ensure the MQ-135 (5V output) is connected via the voltage divider to protect the ESP32 (3.3V Max).
